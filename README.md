## Getting Started

1. Connect to postgres server.

```sh
CREATE ROLE labber WITH LOGIN password 'labber';
CREATE DATABASE midterm OWNER labber;
```

2. Clone a copy of this repository and move to the correct directory.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/mrludovicc/store_name.git
$ cd store_name
```

5. Create an .env file with your correct local information. You may use `.env.example` as a reference: `cp .env.example .env`.

```sh
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=labber
DB_PASS=labber
DB_NAME=midterm
# Uncomment and set to true for Heroku
# DB_SSL=true if heroku
DB_PORT=5432

```

6. Install dependencies.

```sh
$ npm install
```

3. Fix to binaries for sass.

```sh
$ npm rebuild node-sass
```

4. Reset database

```sh
$ npm run db:reset

## Warnings & Tips

- Do not edit the `layout.css` file directly, it is auto-generated by `layout.scss`.
- Split routes into their own resource-based file names, as demonstrated with `users.js` and `widgets.js`.
- Split database schema (table definitions) and seeds (inserts) into separate files, one per table. See `db` folder for pre-populated examples.
- Use helper functions to run your SQL queries and clean up any data coming back from the database. See `db/queries` for pre-populated examples.
- Use the `npm run db:reset` command each time there is a change to the database schema or seeds.
  - It runs through each of the files, in order, and executes them against the database.
  - Note: you will lose all newly created (test) data each time this is run, since the schema files will tend to `DROP` the tables and recreate them.
