2. Create the `.env` by using `.env.example` as a reference: `cp .env.example .env`
3. Update the .env file with your correct local information
4. Use the `npm i` command to install dependencies.
5. Fix to binaries for sass: `npm rebuild node-sass`
6. Reset database: `npm run db:reset`
7. Use the `npm run local` command to start your local web server.
8. Visit http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

## Warnings & Tips

- Do not edit the `layout.css` file directly, it is auto-generated by `layout.scss`.
- Split routes into their own resource-based file names, as demonstrated with `users.js` and `widgets.js`.
- Split database schema (table definitions) and seeds (inserts) into separate files, one per table. See `db` folder for pre-populated examples.
- Use helper functions to run your SQL queries and clean up any data coming back from the database. See `db/queries` for pre-populated examples.
- Use the `npm run db:reset` command each time there is a change to the database schema or seeds.
  - It runs through each of the files, in order, and executes them against the database.
  - Note: you will lose all newly created (test) data each time this is run, since the schema files will tend to `DROP` the tables and recreate them.
